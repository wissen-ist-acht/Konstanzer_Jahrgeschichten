# Konstanzer_Jahrgeschichten

This repository is the basis for a digital presentation of the so-called *Konstanzer Jahrgeschichten*, annalistic records that date from 1256 to 1388. 
Today, twelve manuscripts are known that contain the *Jahrgeschichten*, and as the number of entries as well as their length and dating differ from manuscript to manuscript, it is worthwile to create separate transcriptions.
The transcriptions are diplomatic and are encoded in XML-TEI.

## Manuscripts

The following manuscripts contain the *Jahrgeschichten*:

1. Basel, UB, Cod. E VI 26

 Papier · 231 Bl. · Basel · 1420/30; 1439–71; 1473; 1474; nach 1474

## Transcriptions and digital presentation

The transcriptions of the manuscripts can be found here: [github.com/wissen-ist-acht/konstanzer_jahrgeschichten/manuscripts](https://github.com/wissen-ist-acht/Konstanzer_Jahrgeschichten/tree/main/manuscripts).
A digital presentation, which will accompany this project, aims at making the transcriptions comparable.
To this end, the entries were enriched with meta data, e.g. corrected date/reference date, concrete format of dating (roman numbers, latin numbers, or written out numbers), dating style when referring to a saint (in Latin or in German), asf. 
This enables a comparison from different perspectives and for different users and purposes. 
It also can serve as an example how to encode non-standardized texts to uncover similarities that would go unseen if a mere comparison of the plain text would be performed.
